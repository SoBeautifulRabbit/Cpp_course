# Cpp_course
#### Hi~ I'm Li Dongxu. I'm learning C++
This repository stores small projects of C++ programming class in 2018 spring semester.
</br>
##### Student ID: 2015301510021
##### Teacher: Zhang Hua

Each small project contains:
- The code written by my teacher
- The code written by me

Here is a brief introduction for each project:

## [Project 1: Wawa pick up beans](https://github.com/SoBeautifulRabbit/Cpp_course/tree/master/homework1_Wawa_pick_up_beans)
Wawa is a cute robot who picks up beans in a maze. He can not break through the walls.
Design an algorithm for Wawa, so that he can pick up all the beans with minimun steps.

I have designed a common method to deal with all the 3 cases with walls (case 2,3,4).

This exercise is a beginning for object-oriented programming. It requires students to use classes designed by our teacher.

Notice: this project runs under Microsoft Visual C++ 2010, cause it uses a static library for Visual C++ 2010.

## [Project 2: My Album](https://github.com/SoBeautifulRabbit/Cpp_course/tree/master/homework2_My_Album)
Design an album to manage "photos".

This exercise requires students to: 
- Design classes
- Interact with users
- Use common utilities (XList and XUtility)

This project runs under Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 and 2017.

## [Project 3: Inheritance](https://github.com/SoBeautifulRabbit/Cpp_course/tree/master/homework3_Inheritance)
FLTK is a tool package for drawing.

Use FLTK to draw polygons, circles, etc. Draw a picture with FLTK, and make it move! 

This exercise requires students to: 
- Deal with inheritance and polymorphism
- Use virtual functions

One can never say that he knows well about C++, cause C++ is such a complex and powerful language. I will always keep learning and practicing.
